The architecture of "Say, Pi" takes a modular approach that aligns well with best practices for software development, making the application easier to maintain, test, and expand upon. Each module has a clear area of responsibility:

1. **saypi.index.js**: Acts as the entry point and orchestrator for the application. This is where everything gets set up, and the modules get loaded.
2. **EventModule.js**: Centralizes the event-handling logic. This is an excellent practice because it keeps the event-handling logic decoupled from the UI and other functionalities. It's also easier to add new events or change existing ones.

3. **ButtonModule.js**: Handles the UI logic related to buttons. Having a module dedicated to UI elements like buttons can help make the code more reusable and easier to manage.

4. **AnimationModule.js**: Dedicated to SVG animations, which is again a clean separation of concerns. Having a module just for animations means that you can add, modify, or remove animations without touching any other code.

5. **transcriber.js**: Handles the audio part of the application, including recording and playback. This is an important module to have in an application that relies on audio input and output.

The event-driven architecture allows these modules to communicate without being tightly coupled, which is valuable for maintainability and testability.
