    <h3>How to Install:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Install a userscript manager extension for your browser:</strong> Userscript managers are browser
            extensions that allow you to run custom userscripts on web pages. Some popular userscript managers include
            Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey. Choose the one that's compatible with your browser and install it from the
            extension/add-on store.</li>
        <li><strong>Install and Enable the "Say, Pi" Userscript:</strong>
            Click on <a href="saypi.js">saypi.js</a>. Your userscript manager
            will detect the file as a userscript and prompt you to install it. Confirm the installation to
            enable the "Say, Pi" userscript for the "Hey, Pi" web platform.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Visit the "Hey, Pi" web platform:</strong> Go to <a href="https://heypi.com/">https://heypi.com/</a>
            using your browser. The "Hey, Pi" platform is where you'll use
            the "Say, Pi" userscript to interact with Pi, the intelligent AI chatbot.</li>
        <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You will be prompted to grant the script permission to access your microphone,
            and to make requests to this website (to load resources and transcribe audio).
            Review and accept the permissions to continue.</li>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Injection:</strong> Once you have the userscript manager extension installed and the "Say,
            Pi" userscript enabled, it will automatically inject a "talk" button onto the "Hey, Pi" web interface.
            You'll see the "talk" button appear on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Start Speaking with Pi:</strong> To start a spoken dialogue with Pi, simply click the "talk" button
            and hold it while speaking. The userscript will transcribe your speech in real-time and send it to Pi, who
            will respond with both text and audio.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Compatibility:</h3>
    <p>The "Say, Pi" application is compatible with popular browsers such as Chrome and Edge. Please ensure you have a
        userscript manager extension installed in your browser before using it.</p>
