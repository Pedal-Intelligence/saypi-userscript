<img src="public/logos/marquee.png" alt="SayPi Logo" width="600">

Enhance your voice interactions with Inflection AI's Pi chatbot with the _Say, Pi_ extension for accurate voice dictation and immersive spoken dialogues.

## Description

`saypi-userscript` is a powerful content script that enhances the voice dictation capabilities of Inflection AI's conversational AI chatbot, Pi. By installing and enabling this script in your web browser, you can have an immersive and interactive spoken dialogue with Pi, on the web at https://pi.ai.

## Assembly

The content script is assembled using Webpack with `npm run build` from the command line in the project directory. This will generate a `saypi.user.js` file in the `/public` directory, bundling together all necessary JavaScript modules and assets.
This `user.js` file is what get packaged as a userscript (with `metadata.txt`) and Chrome extension (with `manifest.json`).
